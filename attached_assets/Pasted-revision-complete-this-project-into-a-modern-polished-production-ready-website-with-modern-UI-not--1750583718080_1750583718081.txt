Polyglot" IN ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH ARE MOCKS REMOVE THOSE AND REMOVE THOSE MOCK FRIENDS IN FRIENDS OVERLAY THESE ARE IN PROFILE.HTML.  ALSO WHEN I CLICK CUSTOMIZE IN PROFILE.HTML IT SHOULD SHOW AN OVERLAY WHICH ALLOWS ME TO CHANGE MY PROFILE AND NICKNAME AND THAT SAVES EVEN WHEN THEY REFRESH OR LOGOUT IT SHOULD SAVE NO MATTER WHAT THEY CAN CHANGE IT ANYTIME ALSO PLEASE ADD A NOTIFICATION BUTTON FOR THE TRADE, FRIEND REQUEST ETC. ALSO ALTHOUGH LOG OUT LOGS ME OUT FROM MY ACCOUNT IT SHOULD SEND ME BACK TO LOGIN PAGE I SHOULDNT HAVE ACCESS TO PAGES THAT REQUIRE LOGIN, ALSO IT STILL SAYS COMING SOON IN LESSONS LIST SO UPDATE LESSONS HTML PLEASE, MAKE IT REFLECT ALL 200 LESSONS PER LANGUAGE EACH LESSON IS 1 JSON. ALSO WORD OF THE DAY SHOULD UPDATE EVERYDAY AND ISNT ALWAYS THE SAME

FIX CHANGE YOUR EMAIL AND RESET PASSWORD BUTTON IN SETTINGS.HTML THEY DONT WORK NO FUNCTIONALITY SO MAKE IT WORK, AND ACTUALLY SENDS EMAIL VIA SUPABASE OVERLAY OPENS WITH A BUTTON TO SEND EMAIL AND IT SENDS EMAIL TO ME WITH LINK THAT REDIRECTS TO "RESET.HTML" FOR CHANGE EMAIL IT OPENS AN OVERLAY ASKS ME TO INPUT MY PASSWORD TWICE FOR SECURITY AND IT SENDS AN EMAIL TO ME, WITH A LINK AND IT REDIRECTS TO "CHANGE-EMAIL.HTML" AND THAT NEW EMAIL IS SAVED THATS YOUR NEW EMAIL NOW.

PRIORITIZE LESSONS PLS, YOU NEED TO DO A WHOLE MAKEOVER FOR IT, BECAUSE ITS REALLY BUGGY MAKE SURE COMING SOON IS NO LONGER  THERE AND ALL THE LESSONS ARE LOADED CORRECTLY
ALSO FOR LESSONS THIS IS VERY CRITICAL FIX LESSONS COMING SOON, I HAVE LIKE 200 JSONS ALREADY BUT THATS RLLY NOT ENOUGH ALSO WRITING SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT. VIEW WRITING SYSTEM OPENS AN OVERLAY WHICH HAS THE WRITING (THIS ONLY  APPLIES TO SERBO-CROATIAN, CHINESE, JAPANESE, RUSSIAN AND KOREAN BC THEY HAVE WRITING SYSTEMS, THE NUMBER OF LESSONS DEPENDS ON THE VASTNESS OF THEIR WRITING SYSTEM CHINESE AND JAPANESE MAY HAVE MORE BECAUSE OF CHINESE/KANJI CHARACTERS) NOW ACTUAL LESSONS LIST ARE DIFFERENT ITS 200 LESSONS PER LANGUAGE THATS 20,000 ITEMS PER LANGUAGE OVERALL THATS 140,000 ITEMS AND 1,400 OVERALL LESSONS. THEREFORE THE 200 JSON THAT I HAD IT WASNT ENOUGH, I DONT KNOW FOR WHICH LANGUAGES IT WERE BC I JUST PROMPTED IT. SO THIS IS ALL YOU IN CHARGE DO IT CORRECTLY. MAKE SURE IT WORKS AND NEVER SHOWS LESSON COMING SOON, ALL LEVELS ACCESSIBLE AND ALSO LESSONS. RIGHT NOW THEYRE UNCLICKABLE I DONT KNOW WHY FIX THAT

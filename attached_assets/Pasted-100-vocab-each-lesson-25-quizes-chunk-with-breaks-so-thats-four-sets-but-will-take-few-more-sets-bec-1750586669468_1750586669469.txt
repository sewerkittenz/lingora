100 vocab each lesson(25 quizes chunk with breaks so thats four sets but will take few more sets because there would be mistakes you wanna master by repetition). its very extensive because the goal is 20,000 words, 200 lessons(100 words each lesson, the quizzes have breaks which are when they answered items, during that break theres always a tab that shows how many they got wrong, got correct, skipped, failed, learned words, learned grammar, remainder items, then they have option to "restart quiz" and "continue" when they restart quiz they do it all again same items, when they continue they go to the next quiz) the lessons design(in a tab, has a arrow button meaning to "learn" it which redirects them to learn.html? the "?" is there since its dynamic and depends on the lesson clicked in lessonslist.html, has a "see all items" where they can see all the items in that lesson, the vocabs, grammar etc and theres a toggle star for each which is the starred feature)
learn.html (uses json and logic for the item's data, has progress bar, has settings overlay: they can pick between the 4 modes: flashcards, drag and drop, fill in the blank, type, multiple answers, and match they can toggle those they can do all but never zero. explanation: 4 modes (flashcards(spaced repetition with bad, ok, good), drag and drop to a sentence, fill in the blanks word/grammar, write answer of the meaning of/translation of the word they can fail, skip and submit. fail (purposely to know the answer when they fail it progress bar becomes red and says "fail" then at the bottom it shows a big tab of "Whoops, The correct answer is "____", "______", etc it can have many answers) then for "skip" it means they already mastered that it wont appear next time anymore but it can if they go to settings and click "view skipped items" they can unskip it and skip more items there, and for "submit" it depends if they got it wrong it will say "incorrect" and red progress bar, and it will say "correct" if they got it right also theres alternative words they put any of those and theyre correct, multiple answers theyre shown a word or to be filled in sentence and they can choose from the 4 answers, match word to meaning) (when they get something wrong it will flash and faint for 1 sec "incorrect" and progress bar becomes red, same with "correct", "good" but is green, "skip", "ok" too but is yellow, lastly "fail", "bad" is when red (use json and logic like duolingo) restart quiz, restart lesson, starred only toggle(only starred items are shown), shuffle toggle, "view skipped items" they can unskip it, flashcards section theres a top - bottom toggle they can toggle none (random), both(both of them, basically just like none which is random), any (if they toggle just top it will only first show top but if bottom it will only do bottom first) and lastly set number of items to study by default its 25 items per quiz) also when they get something wrong theres a "incorrect: the correct answer is ____" overlay pause, right? well theres also option in that overlay to say "i was correct" and it will mark them correct incase they made a typo they have that option. ALSO THE "learned words" "learned grammar" they will appear in the home.html it reflects. also u earn xp's when u study every break. one correct = 5 xp, one wrong = -3 xp one fail = unlike wrong it doesn't deduct bc the player isn't aware. skip and ok those dont give xp but good = 4xp bad = -2xp
